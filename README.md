# TTT Game
Not using name of the game, so it does not show up in search results (my GitHub is public, so you can see the code).

#
# Instructions to run
This ```ttt-react-example``` repository is only the wrapper for the game.

It imports the ```ttt-react``` package.

This package is already included in the zip file. Just ```npm install``` to get all other packages.

Then ```npm start```

#
# Why?
This repository represents your regular React app or website. You don't want to put very independent mini-apps into one giant codebase. So, I've separated out the game into its own package. This app only serves to set the container ```div``` size, for the game to fit into.
